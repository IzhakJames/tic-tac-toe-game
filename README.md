# tic-tac-toe-game
Refactored version of a tic-tac-toe game, starting with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript, to using TypeScript and later on, React.js.

Please enjoy the game under Environments > GH-pages > View deployment!
Things to Note:
- Using the whole game, please do not refresh the brower as it will reset everything to 0 (i.e. all the winning stats)
- The reset button is to reset the game board and will not affect the stats of the winning counts.
- The New Round button resets everything as though the browser has also been refreshed.

Thank you and please enjoy yourself!
